	<hr>
	<img class="w-50" src="happiness.jpg">
	<div class="text-justify my-5">
		<p>In this life many people question the true meaning of happiness. Though the meaning of happiness for each person is different. The difference is based on how a person views his life experiences. You yourself must think that you are already happy. But is that true? So, to find out what are the signs of a happy person, see the review below.</p>
		<p><i>Love yourself for who you are.</i></p>
		<p>Maybe some people consider this a strange thing, but this will not sound foreign to you who are happy. You who accept your strengths and weaknesses can maintain your true character. Get acceptance from others or not, you tend to choose to live your life as a real human being.</p>
		<p><i>Look at a relationship as a reflection of you.</i></p>
		<p>Your relationship with friends, colleagues, family, neighbors and others does give a lot of impression on your life. However, their presence or absence sometimes dictates what happiness means to you. But, for those of you who are happy to think of your relationship with others as a reflection of yourself, not as a fill in the emptiness in you.</p>
		<p><i>Accept changes.</i></p>
		<p>You will tend to realize that life is a lesson. Not enough there, you will always be open to change, respectful, and consider all opinions.</p>
		<p><i>Be enthusiastic about others achievements</i></p>
		<p>All those people have their abilities in achieving anything in this life. Therefore, you will believe in your own ability rather than having to compare it with those who have achieved it. You will make it as motivation rather than despair.</p>
		<p><i>Don't let yourself be a victim.</i></p>
		<p>The purpose of being a victim here is to be a victim in life, whether it's unexpected separation, being fired from work, or not even getting acceptance from others. You will tend to choose to let the difficult experience strengthen yourself rather than as a sign of your weakness.</p>
		<p><i>You live at this moment.</i></p>
		<p>Indeed remembering the past or fantasizing about the future is fun. You will realize this and make it as a motivation to take advantage of every moment in your life. If you are a person who lives at this time then you will appreciate every moment in your life and let yourself be in it.</p>
		<p><i>Believe that everything happens for a reason.</i></p>
		<p>There is already life that regulates when people say. You will no longer question everything that happened to you. Because you believe in yourself so you believe that you can handle everything in your life. You will choose to make peace with life rather than curl up in it.<p>
		<p><i>Money is not everything to you.</i></p>
		<p>There is no denying that everyone needs money to live. As a result, many people are competing to get it even by releasing their lives. However, you will not let money become the main dictator in your life. You will still make reasonable choices to your liking.</p>
		<p><i>Dig into you to get a solution.</i></p>
		<p>The term "change from within" is one of the things that holds on to your life. All your actions will be based on that as you live this extraordinary life. Indeed, out there are many books, techniques, ways, or practices to get solutions to deal with many things in this life. But all that will be in vain if there is no awareness of yourself to support it.
