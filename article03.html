		<p>Meditation may be one of the things that you need right now. Because sometimes the world really feels hard to live. Many things that you have been through in the past. And many things that you have not gone through in the future. As if you have to be ready to face it. Yes, facing various kinds of things that might happen. This makes you busy preparing yourself. And make you forget to live more peacefully and enjoy it. But far from it all, no doubt indeed, the world feels increasingly spinning fast. Encourage you to always catch up. Which sometimes makes you like losing direction where you should run. You tend to look for answers outside yourself. Even though the answer itself is only in you. But don't worry, the confusion of your life can be overcome! One of them is with meditation. Meditation will lead you to various things and sensations that are difficult to express. Are you curious about the sensation? Want to know? Well ... here are 4 unique sensations that you feel when you meditate. Let's check this out.</p>
		<p><i>Reduced "me" center</i></p>
		<p>Well ... meditation will make you experience a situation where the center of "I" is reduced. The reduction in the "I" center indicates that there is no longer an assumption that bodily sensations or feelings of anxiety mean that this is the case. Or you far interpret it from something wrong in you. By meditating you will be able to let that anxiety pass and then you will rise. Without you you have to think about it a lot.</p>
		<p><i>Fading away the fear</i></p>
		<p>Meditation will bring you to a state where your stress level is at the lowest point. This does not happen at certain times but also when you really need it. Especially as when you will face an exam or conduct a job interview. Meditation will help you get out of conditions that can make you stressed. Interesting right?<p>
		<p><i>You feel less stress</i></p>
		<p>Meditation will help you find things that make you sad, depressed, and anxious. As long as you know that meditation can clear your mind. Makes you able to get past the root problems that you are facing right now. Which then brings you in inner peace.</p>
		<p><i>You feel less physical pain</i></p>
		<p>You no longer feel your physical pain seriously. Because meditation allows you to control your mind. Yes, control your mind not to focus on the pain. So sometimes you feel physical pain so because of this reason. Well ... besides that you will feel your body become light and fresh. You will no longer feel tired or weak. Wow ... let's try it guys!</p>
		<p>Now ... after you know the sensations of meditation, has there been a thought to do it? All things that aim for your good will not hurt to try you know! Although maybe at first you can't do it right away. But the effort you put in has nothing to lose for you. Sooner or later you will start to feel sensations as mentioned above. Most importantly you do not give up to try it. Keep the spirit!
