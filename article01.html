	<hr>

	<div class="text-justify my-5">
		<p>How often do you rush away from home and come back regardless of your family? In fact, contact with your family is very important for the welfare of everyone. Not just living in the same roof, but your family has more meaning than that. Home and family are an inseparable unity. Where is the house and family where you return and take shelter. Home is one of the most important places in your mental development. Just so you know it's not just doing mindfulness at home. Maybe there are some things about you that need to be changed a little. Curious? Here are 5 tips for you who want to do mindfulness at home. Let's check this out!</p>
		<p><i>You Have Time</i></p>
		<p>Often your time is drained just to balance the demands of life. Then without you realizing it leads you to ongoing stress. And in the end you feel that there is not enough time to establish a relationship with your family. Try to pay attention, whether you can find small moments? Say "good morning" to your family with love is already included well you know!</p>
		<p><i>This Is Not Just About You</i></p>
		<p>Sometimes it's hard not to take heart when someone talks rudely to you. Just so you know this actually happens because the person is experiencing something that you will not understand. You have to respond well, because maybe it's a message that the person is having a hard time. Be open to each other and direct communication in different ways.</p>
		<p><i>Listen to Them Well</i></p>
		<p>What is the difference between hearing and listening? Hearing that is just feeling the sound around you. And listening is a choice to fully pay attention to them. Pay attention to what? Pay attention to the tone and texture of the sound to their emotional state and body language. So next time someone talks to you, be sure to really listen. Do you know how it feels to listen to them? Happy? Offer it to them! Because most people don't tell stories to ask for solutions, they just want to be heard. Be a good one, guys!</p>
		<p><i>Stay Connected with Loved Ones</i></p>
		<p>Being a family member must be related to one another. Especially for a touch, sometimes people still feel strange about it. As long as you know that a touch can be soothing and bring up feelings that cannot be expressed in words.</p>
		<p><i>Maintain a Curious Attitude huh!</i></p>
		<p>All of those people keep on changing and developing in a subtle and little by little way. So instead of assuming you know them fully, look the other way! Develop your open attitude and curiosity towards them in the form of attention.</p>
		<p>You can see the 5 points above are actually small things that you often don't realize. Even though these are only small things, they have a big impact. Go little by little to the 5 points above. And you need to realize that not all of that will work instantly. Then do it with a sure and consistent step. As the proverbial Javanese saying "Urip Iku Urup" which means life should provide a good life for its surroundings.</p>
