	<hr>

		<p>The only thing that remains in this world is change. You wake up to live then fall asleep with a dream that never existed. You who want to rise beyond yourself and restore life in your hands, but community stigma holds you back. And in the end you only live the life they want. Do you realize? But, it doesn't stop there. From yourself, however difficult it is, you must realize that you are connected with your spirituality. Now, here are some signs that your spiritual awareness has risen! Let's check this out.
		<p><i>Feel Changed</i></p>
		<p>You yourself certainly can't explain what changed from you. But clearly you feel the change. That feeling is like taking you deep into your true self. And take you away from the illusion of the mask you have been wearing all this time. Even with that you will question your life.</p>
		<p><i>You Are Aware of Your Bad Habits</i></p>
		<p>You realize you didn't live your life well. So you choose not to go back and make mistakes again.</p><p><i>Not easily attracted</i></p>
		<p>Now there are lots of interesting people or interesting places. But all that will not dazzle you dear! Or are things like this actually making you depressed? Because something that isn't "real" actually makes you allergic. You tend to choose to look for real and simple things. You even think you're anti-social, right?</p>
		<p><i>Comfortable with yourself</i></p>
		<p>You sometimes feel weird just like that with friends or family. In fact, you feel guilty about spending a lot of your time with them. You feel like there is a gap between you and them. This sometimes makes you uncomfortable. Even after that you feel you really need your power refill. Therefore you feel more comfortable by your side than anyone else.</p>
		<p><i>Realizing your dreams</i></p>
		<p>The idea can come from anywhere. This actually makes you have many ideas at once. You feel like you are burning with enthusiasm to make it happen. Because you feel alive if you create your idea. Such is the call of your soul to realize your dreams and mission on earth.</p>
		<p><i>Your intuition</i></p>
		<p>Intuition is like a bridge between you and yourself. You can ask questions and get answers from him. Although you can ask for help from others but only you, your high awareness, who you are, can provide the answer. Spend your time with yourself. And believe in your intuition!</p>
		<p><i>Feel More Connected with the Universe and Everything in It.</i></p>
		<p>You feel part of the universe and everything in it. All your words, thoughts and actions affect each other throughout the universe. And you feel responsible for that. So, always think positive dear.</p>
		<p>Maybe you need to rest after reading this, or reflect on this before going to sleep. Don't give up on who you are now, dear. Spirit!</p>
